# UPDATE April 2024 - I'm running the Detroit marathon in october, so marathon training has been added to this routine

- In 2015 I weighed ~140 lbs at 5ft11in. I hadn't lifted a day in my life and decided I wanted to become huge. 

- I found the stronglifts 5X5 setup and began eating >3k calories a day. 

- As of June 2023 I'm at 185 lbs, down from 191 lbs at my heaviest in January 2023. 16.6% bodyfat.
- As of April 2024 I'm at 175 lbs partially due to marathon training.  

# Routine
- All 5X5 I try to do heavy,
