- In 2015 I weighed ~140 lbs at 5ft11in. I hadn't lifted a day in my life and decided I wanted to become huge. 

- I found the stronglifts 5X5 setup and began eating >3k calories a day. 

- As of June 2023 I'm at 185 lbs, down from 191 lbs at my heaviest in January 2023. ~15% bodyfat I would say. 

# Routine
- All 5X5 I try to do heavy
- Please email me with advice on changing my routine, things that have worked well for you, etc. michaeljlaframboise@gmail.com
