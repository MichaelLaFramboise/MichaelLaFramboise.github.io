I'm an engineer and entrepreneur, and am passionate about emerging technologies and their commercialization. My technical interests span mechanics, electronics and CS. I've worked in several research engineering, sales and PM positions in the automotive and semiconductor photonics industries and have founded two startups.

Most recently I started a company - Voxle - developing holography VR systems as CTO. We raised a pre-seed round and I hired two engineers to work with me.

I worked as a Sr. PM-T at Amazon in their connected devices and cloud services division while studying at UC Berkeley's MBA/MEng program specializing in robotics and AI systems.

Starting late 2021, some friends and I built [0xygen.io](https://www.0xygen.io/), a web3 startup developing an API gaming service. We bootstrapped, generated $50k in revenue and sold the company in the summer of 2023
