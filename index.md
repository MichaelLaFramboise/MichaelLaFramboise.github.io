Below is a summary of my education and career to date. I've worked in several engineering and PM positions in the automotive and semiconductor/photonics industry, have founded a startup in the Web3 SaaS space, and have done research in photonics. My technical interests are mutlivariate and span across mechanics, electronics and software. 

Most recently I'm working as a Sr. PM-T at Amazon in their connected devices and cloud services division, and I'm a student at UC Berkeley's MBA/MEng programs specializing in robotics and AI systems.
