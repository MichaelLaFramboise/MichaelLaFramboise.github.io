## Experience
I've worked in several research engineering and PM positions in the automotive and semiconductor photonics industries and have founded a startup in the Web3 SaaS space. My technical interests are mutlivariate and span across mechanics, electronics and software. 

Most recently I'm working as a Sr. PM-T at Amazon in their connected devices and cloud services division while studying at UC Berkeley's MBA/MEng program specializing in robotics and AI systems.
